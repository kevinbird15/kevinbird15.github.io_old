My name is Kevin Bird and I have a passion for innovation, machine learning, and automation.  

I went to the University of Nebraska in Omaha, NE where I received my bachelors degree in Computer Engineering.  

While I was there, I worked as an Intern at Conagra for 2 years.  I helped automate some server fixes based off health checks that were being filtered into everybody's email folders.  This is also where I learned how to create shell scripts and automate processes.  During my time at Conagra, I was also exposed to data analytics for the first time.  I wasn't doing data analytics myself at this time, but it was at this point where I realized that I wanted to explore this area further.  I had a great experience at Conagra, but I knew I needed to try a smaller company.

At this point, I transitioned to a startup, Flywheel, where I learned a lot about web development and general environment and version control.  I used some of my server experience I learned at Conagra to help analyze logs to detect malicious activity and create a dashboard to show the support team what our customers were saying about us.  

I had a short stint at Sogeti as a consultant where I learned the things I did and didn't like about being a consultant.  I really like the utility that consultants can provide, but shouldn't be the only person on a project.  At the end of the day, I believe that a company needs to have employees that own the process and take ownership of the process.  

I started at Werner Enterprises as a data analyst where my role was to look at data, find insights, and communicate them to the business.  I was introduced to an ETL tool called Alteryx and have been using it since.  During this time at Werner, I helped build out a process that allowed the workflows being built in Alteryx to use event-based scheduling instead of requiring a certain time to be set.  

After working at Werner for about a year and a half, I learned about a project to bring Robotic Process Automation to Werner and I jumped on the opportunity to get back into Automation.  I helped start the RPA team at Werner with a POC where I worked close with business.  I have grown with this team and have done a lot of business process automation.  This involved working closely with business users to understand their manual processes well enough to automate the process.

Over the past few years, I have been learning how to analyze data using online .  I have continued to hone my skills using [fast.ai](fast.ai), Kaggle, and other competitions.  I have had a few finishes that I am happy about including a 2nd place finish in the [HackerEarth Predict the Happiness Competition](<https://www.hackerearth.com/challenges/competitive/predict-the-happiness/leaderboard/>), a 2nd place finish in the [Haha 2019 Funniness Prediction Classification challenge](<https://competitions.codalab.org/competitions/22194#results>), and a 3rd place finish in the [Haha 2019 Funniness Prediction Regression challenge](<https://competitions.codalab.org/competitions/22194#results>).  I also have three top 20% finishes on Kaggle ([Dog Breed Identification](https://www.kaggle.com/c/dog-breed-identification), [Spooky Author Identification](https://www.kaggle.com/c/spooky-author-identification), and [Quick, Draw! Doodle Recognition Challenge](https://www.kaggle.com/c/quickdraw-doodle-recognition))

More recently, I have been focusing on putting our models into APIs so they can be  called by systems that benefit from using the predictions our team is able to output.  This enables us to make any of our systems able to use our algorithms and really opens up the possibilities.  One of the areas I am most excited to use this functionality is combining the RPA work I've done with some of these predictive models to allow a bot to tackle more complex problems that may not be easy this or that decisions.
