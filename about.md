My name is Kevin Bird and I have a passion for machine learning.  I am a [Scott Scholar Alumni](https://www.unomaha.edu/student-life/scott-scholars/program-overview.php) and have a bachelors degree in Computer Engineering from the University of Nebraska.  I have worked in organizations that had thousands of employees and organizations that had just a few employees.  I have been finding my passion along the way.  I never thought of myself as a programmer, but I have kind of turned into a coder of sorts.  I am a follower of the fastai courses and use the fastai library which is built on top of PyTorch.  I am also a big fan of automation and have been part of the robotic process automation team at my current company.  My goal is to empower people to be able to focus on things that aren't super tedious and mind-numbing.  I know that people and algorithms both have limitations.  Being able to combine the strengths of computers with the strengths of humans will allow for a work environment that is enjoyable and productive.
